What is switchwire?
Switchwire enables developers to easily manage signals and slots across an application. It provides a central event management solution that makes it easy to connect objects together based on event names and patterns. With switchwire, objects do not need to know anything about the sender or receiver of events -- all they need to know are the names and signatures of the events. This promotes loose coupling of objects and can lead to applications that are easier to maintain. Switchwire is written in portable C++ code, and has been built and tested on Windows, GNU/Linux, and Mac OSX.

Who should use switchwire?
Application developers who write event-driven programs and who do not already use a signals and slots framework will be interested in switchwire. Developers who already use a signals and slots framework should check out what switchwire has to offer -- it might just be easier than what you're already using!

Who should not use switchwire?
Applications that are designed to be procedural and have little interaction with a user will probably not benefit from switchwire.
