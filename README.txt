Switchwire enables developers to easily manage signals and slots across an application. It provides a central event management solution that makes it easy to connect objects together based on event names and patterns. With switchwire, objects do not need to know anything about the sender or receiver of events -- all they need to know are the names and signatures of the events. This promotes loose coupling of objects and can lead to applications that are easier to maintain. Switchwire is written in portable C++ code, and has been built and tested on Windows, GNU/Linux, and Mac OSX.
