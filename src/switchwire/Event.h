/** @class Event
  * A manageable event (signal). You should never need to use any of the
  * functions here besides the constructor and the signal() operator. To declare
  * an event that can be managed by EventManager, provide the desired signal
  * signature as the first template paramter. To fire the signal, call signal(...),
  * where the elipses represents arguments appropriate to the signature with
  * which the event was declared. The second template parameter is an optional
  * combiner. See the documentation for boost::signals2::signal for more
  * information on using combiners.
  *
  * @tparam T The desired signal signature. Example:
  *           @code Event< bool( int, const std::string& ) > myEvent; @endcode
  *           declares an event which will take an integer and a std::string as
  *           arguments, and which returns a bool.
  * @tparam C An optional combiner. Leave this parameter blank if you don't
  *           require a special combiner.
  *
  * To fire the signal from the above example with arguments 33 and "test", you
  * would use
  * @code myEvent.signal( 33, "test" ); @endcode
